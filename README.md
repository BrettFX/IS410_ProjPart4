# Topic: Musical Instrument Database

*Members: Brett, Justin, and Akhil*

DynaTech offers a Musical Instrument Database to be used to interface with music store websites in which customers are able to browse through various instruments and place orders for delivery. The instruments are partitioned into four different categories: woodwind, strings, brass, and percussion. Customers over the age of 18 are granted the ability to register for an account. Upon registration, the account will be recorded to the database. Various information regarding the customer and transactional data are gathered and data-mined in order to extrapolate favorite items based on frequent purchasing trends.

If a customer spends greater than $2,000 in one transaction, he or she may receive a discount in order to incentivize future transactions of the sort.

Items that are purchased by the customers are shipped to their location. The location will be determined by which State the customer is living in, their zip code, and the address that is on file. All instruments will come in the form of shipments provided directly from a single supplier.

Customers have the ability to select among three different payment methods: card, cash, or check. If a customer wishes to use a card, he or she may use credit or debit. If a customer is using cash, he or she may not be making the order within the United States and thus the currency must be converted to US Dollars accordingly.
